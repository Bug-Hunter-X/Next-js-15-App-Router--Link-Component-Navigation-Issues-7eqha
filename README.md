# Next.js 15 App Router: Link Component Navigation Issues

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using the `Link` component with relative paths.  In certain situations, navigation using the `Link` component might not function correctly, leading to stale data or visual inconsistencies.

## Bug Description

The issue manifests as inconsistent or incomplete navigation using the `Link` component. The page might not fully refresh, retaining old data, or display a mixture of old and new content.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between pages using the `Link` components.
5. Observe the inconsistent behavior.

## Potential Causes

This might be related to how the App Router handles client-side navigation, potential conflicts with other libraries, or edge cases in the routing logic.
